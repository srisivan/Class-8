# Chapter - 2 __Operations On Rational Numbers.__

There are a few properties in addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division, wich has to be satisfied in order to do these operations on rational numbers.

## Properties On Addition Of Rational Numbers.

1. __Closure Property__: This property states that, if you add two rational
numbers, hte sum of them will also be a rational number.

Property 1 : If _a_ and _b_ are any two rational numbers, then, _a + b = c,_ where _c
is also a rational number._

Ex : (3 / 4) + (2 / 4) = 5 / 4, which is also a rational number.
	 Hence, the property is satisfied.

2. __Commutative Property__: This property states that, if you add any two
rational numbers in any order, the sum of them will be the same.

Property 2 : If _a_ and _b_ are any two rational numbers, then, _a + b = b + a_

Ex : (2 / 4) + (3 / 4) = (3 / 4) + (2 / 4)
	 
	 (5 / 4) = (5 / 4), hence, the property is satisfied.

3. __Associative Property__: This property states that, if you add three
rational numbers, in any order, their sum will always be the same.

Property 3 : If _a_, _b_, and _c_ are any rational numbers, then, _(a + b) + c
= a + (b + c)_

Ex : [(2 / 5) + (1 / 5)] + (1 / 5) = (2 / 5) + [(1 / 5) + (1 / 5)]

	[(3 / 5)] + (1 / 5) = (2 / 5) + [(2 / 5)]
	
	(4 / 5) = (4 / 5) hence, the property is satisfied.
