# Introduction

__Curves__: We all know that a sheet of paper is an example for a plane. When
you join points on a plane whithout any break, it forms a _curve_. There are
two types of curves.

(i) _Closed curves_,
(ii) _Open curves_.

# Polygons
A _Polygon_ is a closed curve made up of three or more line segments.\

# Classification of polygons
Polygons are classified according to the number of sides it has.
The most important ones are 

(i) A polygon with three line segments, called a _Triangle_.
(ii) A polygon with four line segments, called a _quadrilaterals._

## Diagonals of a polygon
A line segment joining two non adjacent vertices of a polygon are called its
_diagonals_.

A triangle has no diagonals _et all_.

## Concave and Convex polygons.
A polygon in which all its diagonals lie in its interior, are called _convex_
polygons.

A polygo in which at least one of it's diagonals lie in the exterior, are
called _concave_ polygons.

## Angle sum property of polygons
We can know the angle sum of any polygon, by the formula,
			
			(n - 2) x 180 = sum of all angles of polygon,
			where n = no of sides.

Example:

Angle sum of triangle:
					 
					 Sum = (n - 2) x 180
						 = (3 - 2) x 180,             (n = 3)
						 = 1 x 180,
					 
					 [Sum = 180.]
					 Therefore, angle sum of triangle = 180 degrees.


Angle sum of pentagons:
					
					Sum = (n - 2) x 180,
					    = (5 - 2) x 180,
					    = 3 x 180,

						[Sum = 540.]
						Therefore, angle sum of pentagon = 540 degrees.
