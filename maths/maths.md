# Chapter 1 - Rational Numbers

Before going to rational numbers, first let's _familiarize_ ourselves with the
other sets. numbers can be classified into countless types, such as :
	
* Numbers starting with one,
* Even Numbers,
* Whole Numbers,
* Odd Numbers,
* Fractions, Integers, etc.

But there are a few set that are more important than others. They are :
	
* Natural Numbers
* Whole Numbers
* Integers
* Rational Numbers
* Irational Numbers, etc.

We are going to look at only a few of these. 

1. _Natural Numbers_ : The countable numbers which _start with one,_ are
   called __Natural Numbers.__
   
   Example : Natural Numbers (N) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) } 


2. _Whole Numbers_ : All the natural numbers, _including
   zero,_ are called __Whole Numbers.__
	
	Example : Whole Numbers (W) = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) }


3. _Integers_ : All the _positive_ whole numbers, _including negative numbers_
   are called __Integers.__
	
	Example : Integers (Z) = { -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) }


4. _Rational Numbers_ : All the numbers, which can be _expressed by the form
   p/q, where p and q should be in the set of intrgers (Z), But q should not
   be equal to 0._
