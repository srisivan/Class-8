# Chapter 1 - Rational Numbers

Before going to rational numbers, first let's _familiarize_ ourselves with the
other sets. numbers can be classified into countless types, such as :
	
* Numbers starting with one,
* Even Numbers,
* Whole Numbers,
* Odd Numbers,
* Fractions, Integers, etc.

But there are a few set that are more important than others. They are :
	
* Natural Numbers
* Whole Numbers
* Integers
* Rational Numbers
* Irational Numbers, etc.

We are going to look at only a few of these. 

1. _Natural Numbers_ : The countable numbers which _start with one,_ are
   called __Natural Numbers.__
   
   Example : Natural Numbers (N) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) } 


2. _Whole Numbers_ : All the natural numbers, _including
   zero,_ are called __Whole Numbers.__
	
	Example : Whole Numbers (W) = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) }


3. _Integers_ : All the _positive_ whole numbers, _including negative numbers_
   are called __Integers.__
	
	Example : Integers (Z) = { -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) }


4. _Rational Numbers_ : All the numbers, which can be _expressed by the form
   p/q, where p and q should be in the set of intrgers (Z), But q should not
   be equal to 0._ 

	Example : Rational Numbers = 2/3, -3/5, -5/-7, 4/-5, etc.

* Every integer is a rational number. ( Beacause, '5' can also be expressed as
  '5/1', which is a rational number

* Every fraction is also a rational number. (Beacause, '5/6' can also be
  expressed in the form of p/q.)

* In a rational number a/b, where a and b are both non-zero,
	1. If a > 0 and b > 0, that means a and b are positive, then the rational
	   number a/b > 0, and it is said to be positive. (same signs).
	
	2. If a < 0 and b < 0, that means a and b are negative, then the rational
	   number a/b > 0, and it is said to be positive. (same signs)
	
	3. If a < 0 and b > 0, or a > 0 and b < 0 , then the rational number a/b <
	   0, and it is said to be negative. (opposite signs).

* Equivalent Rational Numbers : If a/b is a rational number and m is a
  non-zero integer, then equivalent of a/b = (a * m) / (b * m).

* Standard form of a rational number : 
	1. A rational number a/b is said to be in its _simplest or standard form,_
	   when a and b do not have a common factor other than 1, and b > 0.
