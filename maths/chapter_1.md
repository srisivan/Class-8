# Chapter 1 - Rational Numbers

Before going to rational numbers, first let's _familiarize_ ourselves with the
other sets. Numbers can be classified into countless types, such as :
	
* Numbers starting with one,
* Even Numbers,
* Whole Numbers,
* Odd Numbers,
* Fractions, Integers, etc.

But there are a few sets that are more important than others. They are :
	
* Natural Numbers
* Whole Numbers
* Integers
* Rational Numbers
* Irational Numbers, etc.

We are going to look at only a few of these. 

1. _Natural Numbers_ : The countable numbers which _start with one,_ are
   called __Natural Numbers.__
   
   Example : Natural Numbers (N) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) } 


2. _Whole Numbers_ : All the natural numbers, _including
   zero,_ are called __Whole Numbers.__
	
	Example : Whole Numbers (W) = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) }


3. _Integers_ : All the _positive_ whole numbers, _including negative numbers_
   are called __Integers.__
	
	Example : Integers (Z) = { -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (till infinity) }


4. _Rational Numbers_ : All the numbers, which can be _expressed by the form
   p/q, where p and q should be in the set of intrgers (Z), But q should not
   be equal to 0._ 

	Example : Rational Numbers = 2/3, -3/5, -5/-7, 4/-5, etc.

# Rational Numbers.

1. Every integer is a rational number. ( Beacause, '5' can also be expressed as
   '5/1', which is a rational number

2. Every fraction is also a rational number. (Beacause, '5/6' can also be
   expressed in the form of p/q.)

3. In a rational number a/b, where a and b are both non-zero,
	
	(i). If a > 0 and b > 0, that means a and b are positive, then the rational
	   number a/b > 0, and it is said to be positive. (same signs).
	
	(ii). If a < 0 and b < 0, that means a and b are negative, then the rational
	   number a/b > 0, and it is said to be positive. (same signs)
	
	(iii). If a < 0 and b > 0, or a > 0 and b < 0 , then the rational number a/b <
	   0, and it is said to be negative. (opposite signs).

4. Equivalent Rational Numbers : If a/b is a rational number and m is a
   non-zero integer, then equivalent of a/b = (a * m) / (b * m).


5.  Standard form of a rational number : 
	
	(i). A rational number a/b is said to be in its _simplest or standard form,_
	   when a and b do not have a common factor other than 1, and b > 0.

6. To find a equivalent rational number, when the denominator is given, _find
  the factor that, when multiplied to the denominator of the question, gives
  the denominator, and multiply the same factor number to the numerator._

	(i). Example : Equivalent of 5 / 12 , when denominator = 60.
			  
			  So, 60 / 12 = 5,
			  therefore, 5 * 5 = 25.
			  Similarly, 5 / 12 = 25 / 60.

7. To find whether two given rational numbers are equal or not, you must _cross
  multiply_ the given numbers. If they are equal, then the original numbers
  are also equal.

	(i). Example : To find if 2 / 4 and 2  / 4 are equivalent or not.
			  
			  Given : 2 / 4 , 2 / 4 
			  So, 2 * 4 = 8, and 4 * 2 = 8
			  Therefore, (2 * 4) = (4 * 2), they are equal.

8. To find whether an rational number is greater or smaller than the other,
   first you have to find the LCM (_Least Common Multiple_) of the pair of
   denominators.  

	(i). Example : Greater or smaller :  4 / 5, 7 / 3
			  
			  The LCM of 5, 3 is 15. 
			  So, 5 * 3 = 15, and should multiply 3 to numerator (4). Similarly, 3
			  * 5 = 15, and should multiply 5 to numerator (7). 

			  Result  = 12 (4 * 3) / 15 , 35 (7 * 5) / 15. 
			  
			  So, 35 / 15 > 12 / 15. 
			  
			  Final Answer = 7 / 3 > 4 / 5.

9. The same principle must be applied to work out asending and descending
   orders.
