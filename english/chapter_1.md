# Chapter 1 : Trust is everything, Nuture It.

_"Love all, trust a few, hurt no one."_
- William shakespeare.


It is a article written by _Mukesh Ambani_ a buisness man in India, whose
father was _Dhirubhai Ambani_, who founded the buisness plan called
_Reliance._ It was Dhirubhai Ambani's way of saying to the world, _"You can
**rely** on me."_ 


_"Without reliance,"_ he said, _"there can be neither trust, nor
relationships, neither family, or life itself."_


Reliance, by his words, said, _"It is a deep sense of honour, a **commitment** to
one's word."_ 


A strong example of trust is the hero-character in the _Ramayana._ The hero is
the son of _Dasharatha,_ named as _Rama_. Dasharatha was the ruler of the kingdom _Ayodhya._ 


When his coronation was nearing, Dasharatha's wife _Kaikeyi,_ demands that her son _Bharatha,_
must be made king, and to send Rama, and his wife _Seetai_ to exile for
fifteen years. He was _devastated._


Kaikeyi had won 2 boons from Dasharatha once upon a time for
helping him. He, therefore, could not break his promise. When his terrible
fate was broken down to Rama by Kaikeyi, and not by his father, who was too
devastated to talk, He might be seen as the very picture of _tranquility._
