Q1. What do you understand by periodization in History?
A1. To characterize the changes in History it is divided into three periods.

* Ancient
* Midevieal
* Modern

These broad divisions mark how the society, economy, culture and politics of
one period changed from that of the other. 

We divide history into periods, on the basis of something which has had a
profound impact on the way we live.

For example, the change from the ancient to Midevieal period occured with
arrival of Turks in India.

of the British on our shores.
