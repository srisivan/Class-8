# Chapter 1 -- _The Modern Period_

1. History is the study of change of patterns in the society. It is the study of
   change. 

2. No two periods in history are alike. Medieval is not like Modern, and Ancient
   is not like Medieval. 

History answers to 4 important questions :

* _What?_ - What event happened?

* _When?_ - When it happened?

* _Where?_ - Where it happened?

* _How?_ - How any why it happened.

## Some important terms in history.

1. _Periodization_ - Historians, for the sake of learners, have divided
					history in three parts, according to the change and 
					impact on the lifes of people.
2. _Colonization_
3. _Interpretations_
4. _Nationalism._


Once history used to revolve around the famous peoople, political events,
only. But noe it has become the history of a common man also. It has been the
subject of how traditions change, the impact of special events on the life of
common people.

A time span in history is more significant than a particular date. A few
decades ago, history was only about political changes, and so it is easy to
define dates for events in political history. But for social, economic and
cultural history specific dates cannot be assigned. 

Changes happen gradually in history. You can't pinpoint a specific date for a
change in history.
