# Crop production and management

## Intro - _How did it all start?_

* Man was an wanderer, he used to hunt for food and did not settle in one
  place for food.

* After a while, he became aware of plants that can be used as food and
  settled near the resource in order to make food.

* After a while, land became less fertile he decided to occupy more pieces of
  land where food could be grown.

* As population was increasing, he found that he was in lack of land to grow
  food.

* He realized that the soil lost its nutrients after a while and regained its
  nutrients after a short break.

* So he decided to cultivate during this cyclic period.

* He also realized that rains (monsoon) was not steady, so he tried to store
  water and use it to irrigate. This is the birth of modern agriculture.

## Crops

* The land where crops are grown is known as a _field_.
* The plants grown in large quantities in a particular field, are known as
  _crops_.

### 1. Crops based on the products obtained

The product obtained from these crops are called _produce._
Some common types of crops are listed in the table below.

Cereals |  Wheat, Rice, Barley, Corn, Ragi
------- | --------------------------------
Pulses | Gram, Peas, Beans
Root Crops | Sweet Potato
Tuber crops | Potato, Tapioca
Oil seeds | Groundnut, Mustard, Sunflower

## 2. Crops based on the season

Most crops grow well only in a certain season. Thus, they are divided into two
categories.

### Kharif Crops
Crops that grow well in summer (June/July - September/October)  are called _Kharif crops._
Some examples are : Rice, Groundnut, Maize, Cotton and pulses are some
examples of kharif cropsm

### Rabi crops
Crops that grow well in winter (October/November - March/April) are called as.
_Rabi Crops_.
Some examples are : Wheat, Barley, Mustard, Potato are some examples of rabi
crops.


# Mordern Agriculture

With increase in population, farmers had to grow more yields of better crops
for the world. He decided that he shouldn't use the traditional methods of
agriculture anymore and expect more from it. 

__So he started to use mordern methods of ariculture.__

This practice began only before a 100 years or so. Before humans used tools
such as _sickle, axe and plough_ to help them to farm, but when machines
crossed the way, the begsn to use tools like _tractors, combine harvesters_
and _threshers_ to help them to farm.
_Fertilizers, pesticides, herbisides_ are some of the mordern methods to
keepsafe of the crops.


# Agricultural Practices

The recent progress has thought farmers to do agriculture in a systematic way.
The tasks that a farmer uses to do this is called _Agricultural Practises._
