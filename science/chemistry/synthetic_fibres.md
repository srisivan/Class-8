# _**Chapter - 1 Synthetic Fibres and plastics**_

## Introduction

## Types of Fibres

Fibres are broadly classified into two groups. They are:

1. Natural Fibres
2. Artificial Fibres

## Natural Fibres
Natural fibres are fibres generated form the plants and animals. They are
_created naturally._ They include fibres such as silk, cotton, wool, jute,
etc.

## Artificial Fibres
Man generated these fibres himself.Such fibres are called _Artificial_ fibres or _man-made_ fibres. They include
fibres such as polyster, rayon, nylon, etc.

**Remember:** Even though the raw material of rayon is wood-pulp, which is
natural, it goes through a series of chemical processes, by man. Thus it is called a
synthetic fibre.

# Polymers
Synthetic fibres are made of **_polymers._** A __polymer__ is a large molecule
formed by the combination of many small molecules, each of which is called a
**_monomer._**

_Polymers and monomers can be compared to a **string with many beads.** The
beads can be seen as monomers, and the whole string with beads in it is
called as a polymer._

_The process of combining the monomers to form a polymer is called
**polymerisation.**_
